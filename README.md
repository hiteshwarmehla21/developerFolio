## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```
### Docker Commands

```
1) BUILD IMAGE : docker build -t developerfolio:latest .
2) RUN IMAGE: docker run -t -p 3000:3000 developerfolio:latest
```


## How To Use 

From your command line, clone and run developerFolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio.git

# Go into the repository
cd developerFolio

# Setup default environment variables

# For Linux
cp env.example .env
# For Windows
copy env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start a local dev server
npm start
```

## Linking blogs section to Medium

Optionally, you can link the blog section to your medium user account:

* Inside the .env file, add key `MEDIUM_USERNAME` and assign your Medium username

```env
// .env
MEDIUM_USERNAME = "YOUR MEDIUM USERNAME"
```

* For GitHub Action, change the environment variable `MEDIUM_USERNAME` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Set `displayMediumBlogs` to true or false in portfolio.js to display fetched Medium blogs, defaults to true.

## Deployment
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend reading through the [Deploying on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.

#### Configuring GitHub Actions (Recommended)
First you should enable, GitHub Actions for the repository you use.

The Profile and the Repository information from GitHub is only created at the time of deploy and the site needs to be redeployed if those information needs to be updated. So, a configurable [CRON Job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) is set up which deploys your site every week, so that once you update your profile on GitHub it is shown on your portfolio. You can also trigger it manually using `workflow_dispatch` event, see [this guide](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch) on how to do that.

- When you are done with the configuration, we highly recommend reading through the [GitHub Actions Configuring a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) docs.

#### Deploying to GitHub Pages

This section guides you to deploy your portfolio on GitHub pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name instead of `https://developerfolio.js.org/` in `homepage` variable. For example, if you want your site to be `https://<your-username>.github.io/developerFolio`, add the same to the homepage section of `package.json`.

- In short, you can also add `/devloperFolio` to `package.json` as both are exactly same. Upon doing so, you tell `create-react-app` to add the path assets accordingly.

- Optionally, configure the domain. You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.

- Follow through the guide to set up GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
